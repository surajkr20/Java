<!-- 
java => platform independent
jvm => java virtual machine (is not platform independent), jvm work for java code to execute, but it's only stand byte code not java java syntax.

java working flow ---
java code =>> java compiler(javac), through converted in =>> byte code(.class)
and then byte code run on jvm,

how many java files, but jvm start execution from first file, is called main(specific signature = public static void main(string a[]))

main looking for this signature = public static void main(string a[])

java code >> compiler(javac) >> byte code >> jvm >> public static void main(string a[])

JRE(java run time environment) => responsible for java code run any where with the help of jre(jvm is also part of jre)
inside the jdk >> jre >> jvm
